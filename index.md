Southeast Asia Team Selection Test (SEATST) is a two-day contest primarily used for International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) selection in Southeast Asian countries.

SEATST 2026 is planned to be held on a weekend in around May 2026. The exact dates will be announced closer to the event.

SEATST 2025 was used for the IOI 2025 selections of Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan. The SEATST 2025 problems are available here as a reference: [Day 1](https://codebreaker.xyz/contest/seatst2025d1), [Day 2](https://codebreaker.xyz/contest/seatst2025d2).

All [ASEAN member states](https://asean.org/member-states/) are welcomed to participate in SEATST 2026 free of charge. Non-ASEAN member states can also use our TST, but will have to pay a small participation fee of <span style="color: red;">20 SGD</span> per contestant.

SEATST replaced APIO as a crucial component of IOI selection in Singapore. We have received excellent feedback from Singaporean students comparing SEATST and APIO in IOI selections.
